Inspired by the Adafruit based impact sensor at [BE conference 2019](http://betogetherconference.com) at the SSIS this project was be recreated with an Arduino, an MPU 6050 for +/-16g and a C2421 BLE module.

Code:

## Alternative:

ESP32, MPU6050, LiIon Battery and OLED display for recent max acceleration. All soldered together to be packed into a rubber duck.

## Rubber duck debugging

Not to be confused with [Rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging). Even though we try and perform this from time to time.
